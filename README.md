# Image Formats
A local copy of some Qt Image Formats plugins

This repository was used as a playground for the DDS and ICNS image formats.
Now, only DDS exists as ICNS is fully finished.

However, future support for DDS is not planned, instead [dds texture format](https://github.com/ABBAPOH/textureviewer/tree/master/src/plugins/dds) is develped
